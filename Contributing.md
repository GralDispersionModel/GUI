# Contributing to GRAL Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Thank you very much for developing the GRAL User Interface (GUI) further or for fixing bugs, so that the entire community can benefit from it!

Do not hesitate to contact the project maintainers at the beginning of your work. 

## Branch Configuration

```
-- main    : production and bug fixes
-- V2XXX   : release ready commits and bug fixes for the upcoming version
-- features/feature-xx: always branch from develop and delete after merging to develop
```

- *main*   branch is inteded for production release. Keep it simple and easy to rollback
- *V2XXX*  branch is for release preparation. Only for release ready commits.


## Recommended Process

If you're developing a **new feature**

1. Create a feature branch from `develop` branch
2. Branch name dependend on your new `feature`
3. When your code is ready for release, pull request to the `develop` branch
4. Delete the feature branch


If you're making a **bug fix**

1. Pull request to the `develop` branch
2. Add an issue tag in the commit message or pull request message

If you're making a **hot fix**, which has to be deployed immediately.
1. Pull request to `develop` **and** `main` branch
