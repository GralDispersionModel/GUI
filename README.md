# GRAL Dispersion Model GUI Linux (Monodevelop) Version<br>
This application is a graphical user interface (GUI), designed to simplify the numerous input values for GRAL (atmospheric dispersion model) and GRAMM (non-hydrostatic mesoscale wind-field model), [edit sources and obstacles](ReadMe/Items.md), import data from shape files, [analyze and display results](ReadMe/Maps.md) as contour lines, visualize wind vectors, and verify the input and output of the GRAL and GRAMM model. It is also possible to visualize and classify [meteorological input data](ReadMe/WindAnalysis.md) (wind roses, stability or velocity classes, diurnal frequencies of wind directions, diurnal mean wind velocity).<br>
There is also a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfEVl-j4P5s) tutorial that shows and explains some basic functions of the GUI.<br><br>

The MonoDevelop branch contains a version of the GUI that is intended to be used with MonoDevelop for Linux (the distribution we use is Debian 11).<br>
